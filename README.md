This project is an SQL-based database system developed to streamline the management processes of architecture firms. Relational tables have been designed to structure and organize data efficiently, accompanied by detailed queries for creating tables and inserting values. The database design underwent a thorough normalization process to eliminate data anomalies related to insertion, deletion, and updates.

The system provides a robust foundation for managing architectural projects, employee records, and client interactions, making it an ideal solution for both new firms and those seeking to upgrade existing management systems.
Data storage in an architect firm is a real time hustle. To make it easier, our 
management database system aims to provide a new solution for data cleansing, 
with a large amount of data. 
Such as--- 
• Customers can get fair ideas of projects. 
• Manager and CEO can observe the transparency of work. 
• Employees information can be easily stored. 
It is estimated that our system might be able to make a huge contribution to 
upcoming market demand.
